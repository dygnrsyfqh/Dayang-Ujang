    <div class="bio">
      <p>My name is Dayang Nur Syafiqah binti Ujang, a 27-year-old Malaysian with a strong academic background in Linguistics and a deep passion for language and communication. I currently work as a Language Specialist, bringing years of experience in crafting, refining, and analyzing language to create meaningful global impact. My journey in this field began with a love for words and their power to connect people across cultures, and it has evolved into a career dedicated to delivering high-quality linguistic solutions.</p>
        <P>Throughout my professional path, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with leading companies, offering specialized services such as translation, localization, transcreation, language policy development, and AI language model training. My linguistic expertise is grounded in both academic theory and practical application, allowing me to approach each project with precision, clarity, and cultural sensitivity.</P>
        <P>Over the years, my work has been recognized through several prestigious awards, which reflect not only my technical skill but also my creative approach to solving language challenges. I thrive on projects that demand both accuracy and impact—especially those that aim to bridge cultural gaps and promote inclusive, effective communication.
